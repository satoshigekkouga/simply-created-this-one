i know that i am wrong somewhere
i need to cool down 
thats for sure
i need to control my emotions especially my anger
 you know what happened that day due to my uncontrollable anger
 you need to contol it
 
 
 but you know that anger can be usweful sometimes
 but that is not just the raw uncontrolled anger
 that is the anger which knows what or whom you are angry upon and why
 is it okay to be angry for that reason
 what action you are going to take at the moment is that okay
 how the action is going toaffect your future plans, state of mind and your relationships with other people
 is it really okay to be angry at the m,atter and is there any other better way to deal with the problem
 be daring 
 you can do it
 control it no matter what
 dont react when you are angry
 no matter what
