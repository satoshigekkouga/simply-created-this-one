i know that i am wrong somewhere
i need to cool down 
thats for sure
i need to control my emotions especially my anger
 you know what happened that day due to my uncontrollable anger
 you need to contol it
 just understand the effects that this one minute anger is gonna make on your life 
 just take deep breaths for some time and think wih a calm mind
